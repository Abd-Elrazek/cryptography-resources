Cryptography Resources
======================

Free online resources to learn Cryptography.

Online courses
-------

- [Cryptography I](https://www.coursera.org/course/crypto) *Stanford University*, with Dan Boneh
	- "This course explains the inner workings of cryptographic primitives and how to correctly use them. The course begins with a detailed discussion of how two parties who have a shared secret key can communicate securely when a powerful adversary eavesdrops and tampers with traffic. The second half of the course discusses public-key techniques that let two or more parties generate a shared secret key."

- [Cryptography II](https://www.coursera.org/course/crypto2) *Stanford University*, with Dan Boneh
	- "This course is a continuation of Crypto I and explains the inner workings of public-key systems and cryptographic protocols. The course begins with constructions for digital signatures and their applications. Next we will turn to privacy applications of cryptography supporting anonymous credentials and private database lookup. We will conclude with more advanced topics including multi-party computation and elliptic curve cryptography."

- [Cryptography](https://www.coursera.org/course/cryptography) *University of Maryland*, with Jonathan Katz
	- "This course will introduce you to the foundations of modern cryptography, with an eye toward practical applications. We will learn the importance of carefully defining security; of relying on a set of well-studied “hardness assumptions” (e.g., the hardness of factoring large numbers); and of the possibility of proving security of complicated constructions based on low-level primitives. We will not only cover these ideas in theory, but will also explore their real-world impact. You will learn about cryptographic primitives in wide use today, and see how these can be combined to develop modern protocols for secure communication."

Lecture notes
-------------

- [CS255 - Introduction to Cryptography (Winter 2015)](http://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo/cs255) *Stanford University*
	- By Dan Boneh. Cryptography is an indispensable tool for protecting information in computer systems. This course explains the inner workings of cryptographic primitives and how to correctly use them.

- [CS 276 - Cryptography (Fall 2014)](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~sanjamg/classes/cs276-fall14/) *UC Berkeley*
	- By Sanjam Garg.

- [89-656 - Introduction to Cryptography](http://u.cs.biu.ac.il/~lindell/89-656/Intro-to-crypto-89-656.pdf) *Bar-Ilan University*
	- This is an outdated draft of lecture notes written for an undergraduate course in cryptography at Bar-Ilan University, Israel. The notes are replaced by the textbook *Introduction to Modern Cryptography* by Jonathan Katz and Yehuda Lindell. There is a significant difference between the presentation in these notes and in the textbook.

- [Introdução à Criptografia Moderna](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/bjoirssm8lhad18/AADmr-ABVb0eW3oSysUQrbKPa?dl=0) *Federal University of Pernambuco*
	- This is a introdutory course is taught by Ruy de Queiroz at UFPE. The lecture slides are in portuguese and are based on the textbook *Introduction to Modern Cryptography* by Jonathan Katz and Yehuda Lindell.

- [COMS 4261 - Intro. to Cryptography](http://www1.cs.columbia.edu/~zeph/4261/lectures/) *Columbia University*
	- By Zeph Grunschlag.

- [Lecture Notes on Cryptography](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~mihir/papers/gb.html) *by S. Goldwasser and M. Bellare*
	- This is a set of lecture notes for a summer course on cryptography, taught by the authors at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), 1996--2008. 

- [CSE207 - Introduction to Modern Cryptography](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~mihir/cse207/classnotes.html) *University of California, San Diego*
	- By Mihir Bellare and Phillip Rogaway. "The viewpoint taken throughout these notes is to emphasize the theory of cryptography as it can be applied to practice."

- [Foundations of Cryptography - Winter 2006/7](http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~naor/COURSE/foundations_of_crypto.html) *Weizmann Institute of Science*
	- "Cryptography deals with methods for protecting the privacy, integrity and functionality of computer and communication systems. The goal of the course is to provide a firm foundation to the construction of such methods. In particular we will cover topics such as notions of security of a cryptosystem, proof techniques for demonstrating security and cryptographic primitives such as one-way functions and trapdoor permutations."
